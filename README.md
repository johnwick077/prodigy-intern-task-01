# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This project implements the Caesar Cipher method for encrypting and decrypting messages. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Convert plaintext into ciphertext using a specified shift.
- **Decryption**: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext using the same shift.

## How It Works

1. **Choose a Shift Value**: This determines how many positions each letter will be shifted.
2. **Encrypting**:
   - Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by another letter that is a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
   - Non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged.
3. **Decrypting**:
   - The process is reversed, shifting letters back to their original positions.

## Installation
